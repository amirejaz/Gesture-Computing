In this repo, I am interpreting human hand gestures using computer vision and deep learning.
                           
#### What is Gesture Computing?             
Gesture recognition is an area of research and development in computer science and language technology concerned with the recognition and interpretation of human gestures. A subdiscipline of computer vision, it employs mathematical algorithms to interpret gestures.
